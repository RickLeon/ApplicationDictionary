# Application Dictionary #
This simple add-on makes it possible to create application-specific dictionaries for NVDA.
To make use of the add-on, just go to the application you want a dictionary for, and press NVDA+shift+p. The normal NVDA dictionary dialog will open for you to add entries valid only for the active application (the application name should appear somewhere in the dialog title).
The default add-on shortcut can be changed through NVDA's input gestures dialog: under configuration node, expand the node that says "Shows the application-specific dictionary dialog".
